        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>This table shows the categories and the amount of audios of each category in the dataset samples.</p>

        <p>The audios are collected from Google audioset [1], CHIME-HOME [2], SINS [3], Eating Sound Collection [4], Freesound [5].</p>

        <p>The original audios from different sources have different sample rates, durations and channels. We unified them into 32kHz, 5 seconds, and mono. For some sources, the durations of those audios are smaller than 5 seconds. Their duration is kept in the original shape. Those audios whose duration is larger than 5 seconds are cut into 5-second segments.</p>
        
        <p>After segmenting the audios, we manually verified the audios and removed the audios which have no sound event or unnoticeable sound event.</p>
